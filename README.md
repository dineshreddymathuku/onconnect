## Configuration Management
Drupal stores all your site's configuration data in a consistent manner. All of your site configuration from the list of enabled modules, through to content types, taxonomy vocabularies, fields, views, and so on, is stored with this system. The system is designed to make it easy to make changes, export site configuration to files, and import those changes back into the site. This allows your site's configuration to be stored as part of your site's codebase, and thus integrated in your version control system and your deployment process.

## Default Content
[Default content](https://www.drupal.org/project/default_content) gives to the profile a way to ship default content as well as configuration.

## Automated Tests and Code Sniffer
This repository is integrated with [Github Actions](https://github.com/pfizer/pfeconconnectpfcom_profile/actions) to perform tests and detect Drupal coding standards violations.
